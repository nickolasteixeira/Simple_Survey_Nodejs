# Eaze Services Homework Assignment - Simple Survey
Create a simple anonymous survey. <br/>

Build an API in Node.js or .NET Core to allow for the anonymous creation/taking of surveys (i.e. you don't have to create a user account to create a survey).

## Specifications:
API Should Support:
* Creating a survey
* Taking a Survey
* Getting Results of a Survey
* A survey should consist of survey questions and each question should have yes/no (true/false) answers

No frontend is needed and any submitted will not be part of review.

Data Persistence: <br/>

* You will need to persist the data in some way. 
* You DO NOT need to use any external data persistance (database,cache etc), and the easier for us to run it the better :).  
* But think about how you would want to do it in production and write up (one paragraph) how you would do it. 

General: <br/>

* Please include a README with instructions on how to run it. 
* Use whatever framework or libraries you like. 
* Finally, have fun!
